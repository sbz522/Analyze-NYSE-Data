# Kaggle New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 Dataset Analysis

This project involves analyzing real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange. The data is a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle containing historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. The project consists of three tasks, which are as follows:

    * Data Analysis and Presentation
    * Development of a Dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement
    * Creation of a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios

# Understanding the Data

The data used in this project is from the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

# Cleaning Up The Data

Although the dataset provided for this project is clean, I changed the column names to have no spaces. This is to ensure that the data is easier to work with in the future.

# Skills Used

The main skills used in this project include:

  * Interpretation of measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
  * Use of Excel functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP)
  * Analysis and forecasting of financial business metrics using Excel
  * Creation of visualizations of a business metric and use of Excel to create a financial forecast model
